                <p>I am a full stack web developer that has a great passion for the craft. To be able to build something out of nothing - going from a blank file to hundreds, thousands of lines of code - is a great feeling and one that I cherish being able to have. Whether it be working in the front or back end, or handling both, taking a project from the humble beginnings of that first whiteboard meeting (or some simple scrawlings on a napkin) and seeing it turn into an MVP,  into a fully fleshed out application, is an experience that I love being able to be a part of on a regular basis. I will treat your project ideas with this same fervor and look forward to working with you.</p>
